        There is One Power, One Being, One Knowingness, One Energy, and the name we give It (God, Spirit, The Universe, Oneness, Tao, Yahweh, Allah, Jehovah, Brahma, Higher Power, Higher Consciousness, or whatever other name we choose) does not matter.
        <br><br>
        It is everything, and It is everywhere.
            <br><br>

        Take a moment and close your eyes. See yourself floating in a great sea of light.
         <br><br>
        Feel the Energy that created you, at work in your life, and see the "boundaries" that define you melt away.
         <br><br>
        Allow your energy to commingle with the energy of the Universe.
         <br><br>
        Know it is all ONE THING...
         <br><br>
